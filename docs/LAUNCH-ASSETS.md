**Title:** Show IH: I built an internal linking tool that doesn't suck

Hey IH 👋

I've been running niche sites for a few years, and one thing always bugged me: internal linking is tedious AF.

Every new post should link to relevant old posts. Old posts should link back to new ones. But who actually does this consistently? Not me.

I tried LinkWhisper ($279/year, WordPress-only) and the suggestions were... not great. "Irrelevant" was the nicest word I'd use.

So I built LinkWeave.

**What it does:**
- Paste your sitemap URL
- AI crawls and analyzes your content semantically
- Get a prioritized list of internal link suggestions
- Export as CSV and knock them out in a weekend

**What makes it different:**
- Works on ANY platform (not just WordPress)
- Uses real semantic AI matching, not keyword stuffing
- Finds orphan pages (pages with zero inbound links)
- $19-99/mo (not $279/year)

I'm offering free site audits to the first 20 people who want to try it.

Drop your site URL below and I'll run it through LinkWeave and share the results.

Would love feedback on whether this solves a real problem for you.

**Title:** Tool I built for my own sites - internal link suggestions + orphan page finder

Been running niche sites for a while and got tired of the internal linking hamster wheel.

Built a tool that:
- Takes your sitemap
- Uses AI to find semantically related content
- Suggests which pages should link to each other
- Finds orphan pages that have no inbound links

Works on any platform, not just WordPress.

Offering free audits if anyone wants to test their site. No catch, just want feedback before I launch publicly.

Drop your sitemap URL or DM me.

(Not trying to sell anything here - tool is free while in beta)

## Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1:**
I got tired of crappy internal linking suggestions, so I built my own tool.

Introducing LinkWeave 🔗✈️

Here's what it does and why it's different 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Problem: Internal linking is tedious.

Every new post should link to relevant old posts. Every old post should link to new ones.

Nobody does this consistently. I certainly didn't.

**Tweet 3:**
I tried LinkWhisper. $279/year. WordPress only.

The suggestions? "Irrelevant" is being generous.

It matches keywords, not meaning. So you get garbage links.

**Tweet 4:**
LinkWeave uses AI semantic matching.

It actually understands what your content is about and suggests links that make sense.

No more "you mentioned 'best' so here's every post with 'best' in the title"

**Tweet 5:**
It works on ANY platform.

WordPress, Webflow, Ghost, custom CMS, static sites.

Paste your sitemap → get suggestions.

**Tweet 6:**
It finds orphan pages too.

These are pages with zero or few internal links pointing to them.

They're basically invisible to Google's crawler.

LinkWeave surfaces them so you can fix it.

**Tweet 7:**
Pricing: $19-99/mo based on site size.

Not $279/year like the competition.

And you can cancel anytime.

**Tweet 8:**
Try it free: [link]

Or reply with your site URL and I'll run a free audit.

Feedback welcome 🙏

**Subject:** Quick question about your internal linking content

Hey [Name],

Love your content on [specific video/article]. Your breakdown of [specific topic] was super helpful.

I built a tool called LinkWeave that automates internal linking using AI semantic matching. It's basically what LinkWhisper should be — actually relevant suggestions, works on any platform, and doesn't cost $279/year.

Would you be interested in:
a) A free audit of your site (I'll run it through LinkWeave and share results)
b) Early access to try it yourself
c) A quick walkthrough for potential review content

No pressure either way — just thought it might be useful for your audience since you cover SEO tools.

Cheers,

P.S. Happy to do the audit regardless of whether you want to cover it. Just reply with your sitemap URL.
