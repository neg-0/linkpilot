# LinkWeave FAQ

Common questions about LinkWeave and internal linking.

---

## General

### What is LinkWeave?
LinkWeave is an AI-powered tool that analyzes your website and suggests internal links between related pages. It uses semantic AI (not just keyword matching) to find genuinely relevant connections.

### How is LinkWeave different from LinkWhisper?
- **Platform agnostic**: Works on any website, not just WordPress
- **AI semantic matching**: Understands meaning, not just keywords
- **More affordable**: $19-99/mo vs $279/year
- **Better suggestions**: Users report more relevant, less "spammy" results

### What's an "orphan page"?
An orphan page has zero or very few internal links pointing to it. Search engines have trouble discovering these pages, which hurts your SEO.

## Using LinkWeave

### How do I find my sitemap URL?
Check these common locations:
- `yoursite.com/sitemap.xml`
- `yoursite.com/sitemap_index.xml`
- Look in your `robots.txt` file

Most CMS platforms (WordPress, Webflow, etc.) generate sitemaps automatically.

### How long does analysis take?
- 50 pages: ~1-2 minutes
- 500 pages: ~5-10 minutes
- 2000 pages: ~15-20 minutes

### How often should I run LinkWeave?
We recommend:
- **Monthly** for active blogs (5+ posts/month)
- **Quarterly** for stable sites
- **After major content updates**

### Can I analyze competitor sites?
Technically yes, but the suggestions are most useful when you can actually implement the links on your own site.

### Does LinkWeave store my content?

### Is there an API?
Yes! Pro plan includes API access. See our [API documentation](/docs/api).
