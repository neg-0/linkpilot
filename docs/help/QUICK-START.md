## Step 1: Find Your Sitemap URL

Your sitemap is usually at one of these locations:
- `https://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml`
- `https://yoursite.com/sitemap_index.xml`
- `https://yoursite.com/post-sitemap.xml`

**Not sure?** Check your site's `robots.txt` file — it often lists the sitemap location.

## Step 2: Paste & Analyze

1. Go to [LinkPilot](/)
2. Paste your sitemap URL in the input field
3. Click **Analyze Site**

LinkPilot will:
- Crawl your pages (up to 50 in free tier)
- Extract content and existing links
- Generate AI embeddings for semantic matching
- Find link opportunities

This usually takes 1-3 minutes depending on your site size.

## Step 3: Review Suggestions

Once complete, you'll see:

### 🔗 Link Suggestions
Pages that should link to each other but don't. Each suggestion shows:
- **Source**: The page to add the link TO
- **Target**: The page to link TO
- **Anchor**: Suggested link text
- **Score**: How relevant the connection is (higher = better)

### 🏝️ Orphan Pages
Pages with zero or few internal links pointing to them. These are often "invisible" to search engines.

## Step 4: Export & Implement

Click **Export CSV** to download your action plan.

The CSV includes:
- Source URL
- Target URL
- Suggested anchor text
- Similarity score

Open in Google Sheets or Excel, then work through the list. Most sites can implement 20-50 links in a weekend.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with high-score suggestions** (0.8+) — these are the most relevant
2. **Prioritize orphan pages** — they need love
3. **Use natural anchor text** — don't over-optimize
4. **Re-run monthly** — as you add content, new opportunities appear
